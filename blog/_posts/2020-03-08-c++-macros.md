# An Introductory Overview of C++ Macros

Brief overview of what macros are, the love/hate relationship many people have with them, and how using them is increasingly discouraged.

## What are Macros?

A more technical explanation of what macros are, with a couple examples of their traditional uses. I plan to pull one from Microsoft’s DX12 rendering boilerplate code here:  
https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples

And I'm still on the lookout for some other interesting examples to include.

## Why Not to Use Them

Controversy over macros and why they can be bad. I’m still learning this so I haven’t picked an example yet, but Nitash sent me a video to watch so I’ll check that out for research.

## Macros in C++ 20

Macros seem to be being phased out in C++ 20, with many of their previous uses being filled by other features. So this last section is a little on macros going forward and how they’re going out of use.

## Conclusions
Summarize and wrap up.
